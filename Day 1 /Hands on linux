Navigation & File Operations
ls, pwd, cd, cp, mv, rm, touch, mkdir, rmdir, tree

File Viewing & Editing
cat, less, more, head, tail -f (for logs), nano, vim

Permissions & Ownership
chmod, chown, umask

Search & Filters
grep, find, locate, which, whereis

Compression/Archiving
tar, gzip, bzip2, zip/unzip

ðŸ”¹ 2. Process & Resource Management

Critical for monitoring AI/DevOps workloads:

Process control: ps, top, htop, kill, killall, jobs, fg, bg, nice, renice

Resource usage: free -m, df -h, du -sh, uptime, iostat, vmstat

Logs & Monitoring: journalctl, systemctl status, dmesg, tail -f /var/log/syslog

ðŸ”¹ 3. Networking Essentials

Needed for debugging APIs, containers, and AI services:

ping, traceroute, curl, wget

ifconfig / ip addr

netstat, ss, lsof -i

scp, rsync (moving models/data between servers)

ssh with key-based auth (important for automation)

ðŸ”¹ 4. User & Security Management

User management: useradd, usermod, passwd, groups

Sudo privileges: /etc/sudoers

Firewalls & security: ufw, iptables basics

SSH hardening: .ssh/authorized_keys

ðŸ”¹ 5. Shell Scripting (Automation)

This is where DevOps + AI meet (automating deployments, data prep, training pipelines):

Variables & arguments ($1, $2, $@)

Conditional statements (if, else, elif)

Loops (for, while, until)

Functions

Exit codes & error handling ($?)

Reading from files (while read line)

Cron jobs for scheduling tasks

ðŸ”¸ Examples:

Log monitoring script

#!/bin/bash
tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep "ERROR"


Disk usage alert

#!/bin/bash
THRESHOLD=80
USAGE=$(df / | grep / | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/%//')
if [ $USAGE -gt $THRESHOLD ]; then
  echo "Disk usage above $THRESHOLD%" | mail -s "ALERT" admin@example.com
fi

ðŸ”¹ 6. DevOps-Specific Linux Skills

Package management: apt, yum, dnf, brew

Systemd services: systemctl start/stop/status

Environment setup: .bashrc, .zshrc, .profile

Containers: docker ps, docker exec, docker logs (most run on Linux)

8. Hands-On Labs You Can Try

System Monitoring Lab
Write a script to log CPU, memory, and disk usage every minute.

Deployment Lab
Automate app startup: shell script + systemctl service file.

Data Movement Lab
Use scp or rsync to copy large datasets between servers.

AI Job Lab
Schedule a cron job that runs python train.py at midnight daily.

Log Analysis Lab
Use grep + awk + sort to find top error messages in logs.
